/**
 * Base implementation for all JavaScript SDK clients.
 *
 * Call the constructor with the corresponding backend constructor and options
 * specific to the client subclass. To access these options later, use
 * {@link Client.getOptions}. Also, the Backend instance is available via
 * {@link Client.getBackend}.
 *
 * If a Dsn is specified in the options, it will be parsed and stored. Use
 * {@link Client.getDsn} to retrieve the Dsn at any moment. In case the Dsn is
 * invalid, the constructor will throw a {@link SentryException}. Note that
 * without a valid Dsn, the SDK will not send any events to Sentry.
 *
 * Before sending an event via the backend, it is passed through
 * {@link BaseClient.prepareEvent} to add SDK information and scope data
 * (breadcrumbs and context). To add more custom information, override this
 * method and extend the resulting prepared event.
 *
 * To issue automatically created events (e.g. via instrumentation), use
 * {@link Client.captureEvent}. It will prepare the event and pass it through
 * the callback lifecycle. To issue auto-breadcrumbs, use
 * {@link Client.addBreadcrumb}.
 *
 * @example
 * class NodeClient extends BaseClient<NodeBackend, NodeOptions> {
 *   public constructor(options: NodeOptions) {
 *     super(NodeBackend, options);
 *   }
 *
 *   // ...

These operators accept any value of\nthe Number type but first convert each such value to one of 2<sup>32</sup> integer values.\"\n\nIn some use cases, however, it is required to be able to reliably work with and perform bitwise operations on the full\n64 bits. This is where long.js comes into play.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe class is compatible with CommonJS and AMD loaders and is exposed globally as `Long` if neither is available.\n\n```javascript\nvar Long = require(\"long\");\n\nvar longVal = new Long(0xFFFFFFFF, 0x7FFFFFFF);\n\nconsole.log(longVal.toString());\n...\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### Constructor\n\n* new **Long**(low: `number`, high: `number`, unsigned?: `boolean`)<br />\n  Constructs a 64 bit two's-complement integer, given its low and high 32 bit values as *signed* integers.

arithmetic out of the box, hence a [tiny WebAssembly module](./src/wasm.wat) is used to compute operations like multiplication, division and remainder more efficiently (slow operations like division are around twice as fast), falling back to floating point based computations in JavaScript where WebAssembly is not yet supported, e.g., in older versions of node.\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nTo build an UMD bundle to `dist/long.js`, run:\n\n```\n$> npm install\n$> npm run build\n```\n\nRunning the [tests](./tests):\n\n```\n$> npm test\n```\n",

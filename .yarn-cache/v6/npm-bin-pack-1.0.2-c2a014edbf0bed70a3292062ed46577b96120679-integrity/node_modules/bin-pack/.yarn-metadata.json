Largely based on [code][code] and a\n[blog post][post] by Jake Gordon.\n\nThis library packs objects that have a width and a height into as small of a\nsquare as possible, using a binary tree bin packing algorithm. After packing,\neach object is given an (x, y) coordinate of where it would be optimally\npacked.\n\nThe algorithm may not find the *optimal* bin packing, but it should do pretty\nwill for things like sprite maps.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install bin-pack\n```\n\n## Use\n\n```\nvar pack = require('bin-pack');\nvar bins = [\n\t{ width: 10,  height: 20 },\n\t{ width: 100, height: 100 },\n\t{ width: 50,  height: 19 },\n\t...\n\t];\n\nvar result = pack(bins);\n\n// result.width: width of the containing box\n// result.height: height of the containing box\n// result.items: packed items\n// result.items[0].x: x coordinate of the packed box\n// result.items[0].y: y coordinate of the packed box\n// result.items[0].width: width of the packed box\n// result.items[0].height: height of the packed box\n// result.items[0].item: original object that was passed in\n```\n\nIf your object doesn't have `x` and `y` properties, and you don't mind a\nlibrary writing to your objects, then specify `inPlace: true` and your objects\nwill have a `x` and `y` properties added to them.\n\n```\nvar pack = require('bin-pack');\nvar bins = [\n\t{ width: 10,  height: 20 },\n\t{ width: 100, height: 100 },\n\t{ width: 50,  height: 19 },\n\t...\n\t];\n\nvar result = pack(bins, { inPlace: true });\n// result.width: width of the containing box\n// result.height: height of the containing box\n// bins[0].x: x coordinate of the packed box\n// bins[0].y: y coordinate of the packed box\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributing tests, documentation, or code is all appreciated. All code should\nbe accompanied by valid tests.\n\n[code]: https://github.com/jakesgordon/bin-packing\n[post]: http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/7/bin_packing/\n",

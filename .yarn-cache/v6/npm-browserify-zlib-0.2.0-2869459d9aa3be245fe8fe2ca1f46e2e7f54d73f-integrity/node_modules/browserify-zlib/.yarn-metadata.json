Can be used as a drop in replacement with [Browserify](http://browserify.org) and [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).\n\nThe heavy lifting is done using [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako). The code in this module is modeled closely after the code in the source of Node core to get as much compatability as possible.\n\n## API\n\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html\n\n## Not implemented\n\nThe following options/methods are not supported because pako does not support them yet.\n\n* The `params` method\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

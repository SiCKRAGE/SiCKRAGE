This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of `this`, if available, otherwise the object's `[[Class]]` internal property.\n- `getFunction`: returns the current function.\n- `getFunctionName`: returns the name of the current function, typically its `name` property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.\n- `getMethodName`: returns the name of the property of `this` or one of its prototypes that holds the current function.\n- `getFileName`: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script.\n- `getLineNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number.\n- `getColumnNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number\n- `getEvalOrigin`: if this function was created using a call to `eval` returns a string representing the location where `eval` was called.\n- `isToplevel`: is this a top-level invocation, that is, is this the global object?\n- `isEval`: does this call take place in code defined by a call to `eval`?\n- `isNative`: is this call in native V8 code?\n- `isConstructor`: is this a constructor call?\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n",

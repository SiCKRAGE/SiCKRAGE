    "readme": "## Caseless -- wrap an object to set and get property with caseless semantics but also preserve caseing.\n\nThis library is incredibly useful when working with HTTP headers. It allows you to get/set/check for headers in a caseless manner while also preserving the caseing of headers the first time they are set.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar headers = {}\n  , c = caseless(headers)\n  ;\nc.set('a-Header', 'asdf')\nc.get('a-header') === 'asdf'\n```\n\n## has(key)\n\nHas takes a name and if it finds a matching header will return that header name with the preserved caseing it was set with.\n\n```javascript\nc.has('a-header') === 'a-Header'\n```\n\n## set(key, value[, clobber=true])\n\nSet is fairly straight forward except that if the header exists and clobber is disabled it will add `','+value` to the existing header.\n\n```javascript\nc.set('a-Header', 'fdas')\nc.set('a-HEADER', 'more', false)\nc.get('a-header') === 'fdsa,more'\n```\n\n## swap(key)\n\nSwaps the casing of a header with the new one that is passed in.\n\n```javascript\nvar headers = {}\n  , c = caseless(headers)\n  ;\nc.set('a-Header', 'fdas')\nc.swap('a-HEADER')\nc.has('a-header') === 'a-HEADER'\nheaders === {'a-HEADER': 'fdas'}\n```\n",

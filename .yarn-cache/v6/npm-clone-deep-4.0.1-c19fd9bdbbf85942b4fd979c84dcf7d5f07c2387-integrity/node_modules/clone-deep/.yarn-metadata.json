This value may be `true` or the function use for cloning instances.\n\nWhen an `instanceClone` function is provided, it will be invoked to clone objects that are not \"plain\" objects (as defined by [isPlainObject](#isPlainObject)`isPlainObject`). If `instanceClone` is not specified, this library will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will simply copy the object reference.\n\n## Attribution\n\nInitially based on [mout's](https://github.com/mout/mout) implementation of deepClone.\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.

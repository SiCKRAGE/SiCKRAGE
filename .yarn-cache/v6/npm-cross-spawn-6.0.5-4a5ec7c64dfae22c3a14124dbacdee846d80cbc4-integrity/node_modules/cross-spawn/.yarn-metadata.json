This new option solves\nthe [PATHEXT](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2318) issue but:\n\n- It's not supported in node `<v4.8`\n- You must manually escape the command and arguments which is very error prone, specially when passing user input\n- There are a lot of other unresolved issues from the [Why](#why) section that you must take into account\n\nIf you are using the `shell` option to spawn a command in a cross platform way, consider using `cross-spawn` instead. You have been warned.\n\n### `options.shell` support\n\nWhile `cross-spawn` adds support for `options.shell` in node `<v4.8`, all of its enhancements are disabled.\n\nThis mimics the Node.js behavior. More specifically, the command and its arguments will not be automatically escaped nor shebang support will be offered. This is by design because if you are using `options.shell` you are probably targeting a specific platform anyway and you don't want things to get into your way.\n\n### Shebangs support\n\nWhile `cross-spawn` handles shebangs on Windows, its support is limited. More specifically, it just supports `#!/usr/bin/env <program>` where `<program>` must not contain any arguments.   \nIf you would like to have the shebang support improved, feel free to contribute via a pull-request.\n\nRemember to always test your code on Windows!\n\n\n## Tests\n\n`$ npm test`   \n`$ npm test -- --watch` during development\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n",

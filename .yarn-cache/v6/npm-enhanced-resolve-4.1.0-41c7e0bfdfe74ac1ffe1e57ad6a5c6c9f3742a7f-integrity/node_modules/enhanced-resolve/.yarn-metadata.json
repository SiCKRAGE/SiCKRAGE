It's highly configurable.\n\n## Features\n\n* plugin system\n* provide a custom filesystem\n* sync and async node.js filesystems included\n\n\n## Getting Started\n### Install\n```sh\n# npm\nnpm install enhanced-resolve\n# or Yarn\nyarn add enhanced-resolve\n```\n\n### Creating a Resolver\nThe easiest way to create a resolver is to use the `createResolver` function on `ResolveFactory`, along with one of the supplied File System implementations.\n```js\nconst {\n  NodeJsInputFileSystem,\n  CachedInputFileSystem,\n  ResolverFactory\n} = require('enhanced-resolve');\n\n// create a resolver\nconst myResolver = ResolverFactory.createResolver({\n  // Typical usage will consume the `NodeJsInputFileSystem` + `CachedInputFileSystem`, which wraps the Node.js `fs` wrapper to add resilience + caching.\n  fileSystem: new CachedInputFileSystem(new NodeJsInputFileSystem(), 4000),\n  extensions: ['.js', '.json']\n  /* any other resolver options here. Options/defaults can be seen below */\n});\n\n// resolve a file with the new resolver\nconst context = {};\nconst resolveContext = {};\nconst lookupStartPath = '/Users/webpack/some/root/dir';\nconst request = './path/to-look-up.js';\nmyResolver.resolve({}, lookupStartPath, request, resolveContext, (err/*Error*/, filepath/*string*/) => {\n  // Do something with the path\n});\n```\n\nFor more examples creating different types resolvers (sync/async, context, etc) see `lib/node.js`.\n#### Resolver Options\n| Field                    | Default                     | Description                                                                        |\n| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| alias                    | []                          | A list of module alias configurations or an object which maps key to value |\n| aliasFields              | []                          | A list of alias fields in description files |\n| cacheWithContext         | true                        | If unsafe cache is enabled, includes `request.context` in the cache key  |\n| descriptionFiles         | [\"package.json\"]            | A list of description files to read from |\n| enforceExtension         | false                       | Enforce that a extension from extensions must be used |\n| enforceModuleExtension   | false                       | Enforce that a extension from moduleExtensions must be used |\n| extensions               | [\".js\", \".json\", \".node\"]   | A list of extensions which should be tried for files |\n| mainFields               | [\"main\"]                    | A list of main fields in description files |\n| mainFiles                | [\"index\"]                   | A list of main files in directories |\n| modules                  | [\"node_modules\"]            | A list of directories to resolve modules from, can be absolute path or folder name |\n| unsafeCache              | false                       | Use this cache object to unsafely cache the successful requests |\n| plugins                  | []                          | A list of additional resolve plugins which should be applied |\n| symlinks                 | true                        | Whether to resolve symlinks to their symlinked location |\n| cachePredicate           | function() { return true }; | A function which decides whether a request should be cached or not. An object is passed to the function with `path` and `request` properties. |\n| moduleExtensions         | []                          | A list of module extensions which should be tried for modules |\n| resolveToContext         | false                       | Resolve to a context instead of a file |\n| fileSystem               |                             | The file system which should be used |\n| resolver                 | undefined                   | A prepared Resolver to which the plugins are attached |\n\n## Plugins\nSimilar to `webpack`, the core of `enhanced-resolve` functionality is implemented as individual plugins that are executed using [`Tapable`](https://github.com/webpack/tapable). These plugins can extend the functionality of the library, adding other ways for files/contexts to be resolved.\n\nA plugin should be a `class` (or its ES5 equivalent) with an `apply` method. The `apply` method will receive a `resolver` instance, that can be used to hook in to the event system.\n\n### Plugin Boilerplate\n```js\nclass MyResolverPlugin {\n  constructor(source, target) {\n    this.source = source;\n    this.target = target;\n  }\n\n  apply(resolver) {\n    const target = resolver.ensureHook(this.target);\n    resolver.getHook(this.source).tapAsync(\"MyResolverPlugin\", (request, resolveContext, callback) => {\n      // Any logic you need to create a new `request` can go here\n      resolver.doResolve(target, request, null, resolveContext, callback);\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlugins are executed in a pipeline, and register which event they should be executed before/after. In the example above, `source` is the name of the event that starts the pipeline, and `target` is what event this plugin should fire, which is what continues the execution of the pipeline. For an example of how these different plugin events create a chain, see `lib/ResolverFactory.js`, in the `//// pipeline ////` section.\n\n## Tests\n\n``` javascript\nnpm test\n```\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve)\n\n\n## Passing options from webpack\nIf you are using `webpack`, and you want to pass custom options to `enhanced-resolve`, the options are passed from the `resolve` key of your webpack configuration e.g.:\n\n```\nresolve: {\n  extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx'],\n  modules: ['src', 'node_modules'],\n  plugins: [new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin()]\n  ...\n},\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2016 Tobias Koppers\n\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n",

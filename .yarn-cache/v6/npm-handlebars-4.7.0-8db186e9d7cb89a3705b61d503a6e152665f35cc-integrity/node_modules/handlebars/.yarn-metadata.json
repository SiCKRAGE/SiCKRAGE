    "readme": "[![Travis Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/wycats/handlebars.js/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/wycats/handlebars.js)\n[![Appveyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/wycats/handlebars.js?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wycats/handlebars-js)\n[![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/buildstatus/handlebars)](https://saucelabs.com/u/handlebars)\n\nHandlebars.js\n=============\n\nHandlebars.js is an extension to the [Mustache templating\nlanguage](http://mustache.github.com/) created by Chris Wanstrath.\nHandlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that\nkeep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be.\n\nCheckout the official Handlebars docs site at\n[https://handlebarsjs.com/](https://handlebarsjs.com) and the live demo at [http://tryhandlebarsjs.com/](http://tryhandlebarsjs.com/).\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nSee our [installation documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com/installation/).\n\nUsage\n-----\nIn general, the syntax of Handlebars.js templates is a superset\nof Mustache templates. For basic syntax, check out the [Mustache\nmanpage](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html).\n\nOnce you have a template, use the `Handlebars.compile` method to compile\nthe template into a function. The generated function takes a context\nargument, which will be used to render the template.\n\n```js\nvar source = \"<p>Hello, my name is {{name}}. I am from {{hometown}}. I have \" +\n             \"{{kids.length}} kids:</p>\" +\n             \"<ul>{{#kids}}<li>{{name}} is {{age}}</li>{{/kids}}</ul>\";\nvar template = Handlebars.compile(source);\n\nvar data = { \"name\": \"Alan\", \"hometown\": \"Somewhere, TX\",\n             \"kids\": [{\"name\": \"Jimmy\", \"age\": \"12\"}, {\"name\": \"Sally\", \"age\": \"4\"}]};\nvar result = template(data);\n\n// Would render:\n// <p>Hello, my name is Alan. I am from Somewhere, TX. I have 2 kids:</p>\n// <ul>\n//   <li>Jimmy is 12</li>\n//   <li>Sally is 4</li>\n// </ul>\n```\n\nFull documentation and more examples are at [handlebarsjs.com](https://handlebarsjs.com/).\n\nPrecompiling Templates\n----------------------\n\nHandlebars allows templates to be precompiled and included as javascript code rather than the handlebars template allowing for faster startup time. Full details are located [here](https://handlebarsjs.com/installation/precompilation.html).\n\nDifferences Between Handlebars.js and Mustache\n----------------------------------------------\nHandlebars.js adds a couple of additional features to make writing\ntemplates easier and also changes a tiny detail of how partials work.\n\n- [Nested Paths](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#path-expressions)\n- [Helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#helpers)\n- [Block Expressions](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/block-helpers.html#basic-blocks)\n- [Literal Values](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#literal-segments)\n- [Delimited Comments](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#template-comments)\n\nBlock expressions have the same syntax as mustache sections but should not be confused with one another. Sections are akin to an implicit `each` or `with` statement depending on the input data and helpers are explicit pieces of code that are free to implement whatever behavior they like. The [mustache spec](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) defines the exact behavior of sections. In the case of name conflicts, helpers are given priority.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nThere are a few Mustache behaviors that Handlebars does not implement.\n- Handlebars deviates from Mustache slightly in that it does not perform recursive lookup by default. The compile time `compat` flag must be set to enable this functionality. Users should note that there is a performance cost for enabling this flag. The exact cost varies by template, but it's recommended that performance sensitive operations should avoid this mode and instead opt for explicit path references.\n- The optional Mustache-style lambdas are not supported. Instead Handlebars provides its own lambda resolution that follows the behaviors of helpers.\n- Alternative delimiters are not supported.\n\n\nSupported Environments\n----------------------\n\nHandlebars has been designed to work in any ECMAScript 3 environment. This includes\n\n- Node.js\n- Chrome\n- Firefox\n- Safari 5+\n- Opera 11+\n- IE 6+\n\nOlder versions and other runtimes are likely to work but have not been formally\ntested. The compiler requires `JSON.stringify` to be implemented natively or via a polyfill. If using the precompiler this is not necessary.\n\n[![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/handlebars.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/handlebars)\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n\nIn a rough performance test, precompiled Handlebars.js templates (in\nthe original version of Handlebars.js) rendered in about half the\ntime of Mustache templates. It would be a shame if it were any other\nway, since they were precompiled, but the difference in architecture\ndoes have some big performance advantages. Justin Marney, a.k.a.\n[gotascii](http://github.com/gotascii), confirmed that with an\n[independent test](http://sorescode.com/2010/09/12/benchmarks.html). The\nrewritten Handlebars (current version) is faster than the old version,\nwith many [performance tests](https://travis-ci.org/wycats/handlebars.js/builds/33392182#L538) being 5 to 7 times faster than the Mustache equivalent.\n\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n\nSee [release-notes.md](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md) for upgrade notes.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nSee [FAQ.md](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/FAQ.md) for known issues and common pitfalls.\n\n\nHandlebars in the Wild\n----------------------\n\n* [Assemble](http://assemble.io), by [@jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert)\n  and [@doowb](https://github.com/doowb), is a static site generator that uses Handlebars.js\n  as its template engine.\n* [Cory](https://github.com/leo/cory), by [@leo](https://github.com/leo), is another tiny static site generator\n* [CoSchedule](http://coschedule.com) An editorial calendar for WordPress that uses Handlebars.js\n* [dashbars](https://github.com/pismute/dashbars) A modern helper library for Handlebars.js.\n* [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) makes Handlebars.js the primary way to\n  structure your views, also with automatic data binding support.\n* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) Just a blogging platform.\n* [handlebars_assets](http://github.com/leshill/handlebars_assets): A Rails Asset Pipeline gem\n  from Les Hill (@leshill).\n* [handlebars-helpers](https://github.com/assemble/handlebars-helpers) is an extensive library\n  with 100+ handlebars helpers.\n* [handlebars-layouts](https://github.com/shannonmoeller/handlebars-layouts) is a set of helpers which implement extendible and embeddable layout blocks as seen in other popular templating languages.\n* [hbs](http://github.com/donpark/hbs): An Express.js view engine adapter for Handlebars.js,\n  from Don Park.\n* [koa-hbs](https://github.com/jwilm/koa-hbs): [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) generator based\n  renderer for Handlebars.js.\n* [jblotus](http://github.com/jblotus) created [http://tryhandlebarsjs.com](http://tryhandlebarsjs.com)\n  for anyone who would like to try out Handlebars.js in their browser.\n* [jQuery plugin](http://71104.github.io/jquery-handlebars/): allows you to use\n  Handlebars.js with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).\n* [Lumbar](http://walmartlabs.github.io/lumbar) provides easy module-based template management for\n  handlebars projects.\n* [Marionette.Handlebars](https://github.com/hashchange/marionette.handlebars) adds support for Handlebars and Mustache templates to Marionette.\n* [sammy.js](http://github.com/quirkey/sammy) by Aaron Quint, a.k.a. quirkey,\n  supports Handlebars.js as one of its template plugins.\n* [SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com) uses Handlebars.js as its main\n  templating engine, extending it with automatic data binding support.\n* [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/handlebars/) implements a port of handlebars\n* [Swag](https://github.com/elving/swag) by [@elving](https://github.com/elving) is a growing collection of helpers for handlebars.js.

If `opts` is a non-object, it will be treated as\nthe `opts.mode`.\n\nIf `opts.mode` isn't specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.\n\n`cb(err, made)` fires with the error or the first directory `made`\nthat had to be created, if any.\n\nYou can optionally pass in an alternate `fs` implementation by passing in\n`opts.fs`. Your implementation should have `opts.fs.mkdir(path, mode, cb)` and\n`opts.fs.stat(path, cb)`.\n\n## mkdirp.sync(dir, opts)\n\nSynchronously create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at `dir`\nwith octal permission string `opts.mode`. If `opts` is a non-object, it will be\ntreated as the `opts.mode`.\n\nIf `opts.mode` isn't specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.\n\nReturns the first directory that had to be created, if any.\n\nYou can optionally pass in an alternate `fs` implementation by passing in\n`opts.fs`. Your implementation should have `opts.fs.mkdirSync(path, mode)` and\n`opts.fs.statSync(path)`.\n\n# usage\n\nThis package also ships with a `mkdirp` command.\n\n```\nusage: mkdirp [DIR1,DIR2..] {OPTIONS}\n\n  Create each supplied directory including any necessary parent directories that\n  don't yet exist.\n  \n  If the directory already exists, do nothing.\n\nOPTIONS are:\n\n  -m, --mode   If a directory needs to be created, set the mode as an octal\n               permission string.\n\n```\n\n# install\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install mkdirp\n```\n\nto get the library, or\n\n```\nnpm install -g mkdirp\n```\n\nto get the command.\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n",

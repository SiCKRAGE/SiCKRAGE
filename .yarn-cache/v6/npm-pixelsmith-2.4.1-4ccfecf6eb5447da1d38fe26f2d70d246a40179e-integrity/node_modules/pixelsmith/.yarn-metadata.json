    "readme": "# pixelsmith [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/pixelsmith.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/pixelsmith)\n\nNode based engine for [spritesmith][] built of top of [get-pixels][] and [save-pixels][].\n\n[spritesmith]: https://github.com/Ensighten/spritesmith\n[get-pixels]: https://github.com/mikolalysenko/get-pixels\n[save-pixels]: https://github.com/mikolalysenko/save-pixels\n\nThis can be used for constructing a canvas, placing images on it, and extracting the result image.\n\n## Getting Started\nInstall the module with: `npm install pixelsmith`\n\n```js\n// Load in our dependencies\nvar Pixelsmith = require('pixelsmith');\n\n// Create a new engine\nvar pixelsmith = new Pixelsmith();\n\n// Interpret some images from disk\npixelsmith.createImages(['img1.jpg', 'img2.png'], function handleImages (err, imgs) {\n  // If there was an error, throw it\n  if (err) {\n    throw err;\n  }\n\n  // We recieve images in the same order they were given\n  imgs[0].width; // 50 (pixels)\n  imgs[0].height; // 100 (pixels)\n\n  // Create a canvas that fits our images (200px wide, 300px tall)\n  var canvas = pixelsmith.createCanvas(200, 300);\n\n  // Add the images to our canvas (at x=0, y=0 and x=50, y=100 respectively)\n  canvas.addImage(imgs[0], 0, 0);\n  canvas.addImage(imgs[1], 50, 100);\n\n  // Export canvas to image\n  var resultStream = canvas['export']({format: 'png'});\n  resultStream; // Readable stream outputting PNG image of the canvas\n});\n```\n\n## Documentation\nThis module was built to the specification for spritesmith engines.\n\n**Specification version:** 2.0.0\n\nhttps://github.com/twolfson/spritesmith-engine-spec/tree/2.0.0\n\n### `engine.createImages(images, cb)`\nOur `createImages` methods supports the following types of images:\n\n- image `String` - Filepath to image\n- image `Object` - Vinyl object with buffer for image (uses buffer)\n- image `Object` - Vinyl object with stream for image (uses stream)\n- image `Object` - Vinyl object with `null` for image (reads buffer from provided filepath)\n\n### `canvas.export(options)`\nOur `export` method provides support for the following options:\n\n- options `Object`\n    - background `Number[]` - `rgba` array of value for background\n        - By default, the background is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (transparent black)\n        - `[0]` - Red value for background\n            - Can range from 0 to 255\n        - `[1]` - Green value for background\n            - Can range from 0 to 255\n        - `[2]` - Blue value for background\n            - Can range from 0 to 255\n        - `[3]` - Alpha/transparency value for background\n            - Can range from 0 to 255\n    - quality `Number` - Optional quality percentage for JPEG images\n        - This value can range from 0 to 100\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint via `npm run lint` and test via `npm test`.\n\n## Donating\nSupport this project and [others by twolfson][twolfson-projects] via [donations][twolfson-support-me].\n\n<http://twolfson.com/support-me>\n\n[twolfson-projects]: http://twolfson.com/projects\n[twolfson-support-me]: http://twolfson.com/support-me\n\n## Unlicense\nAs of Nov 24 2014, Todd Wolfson has released this repository and its contents to the public domain.\n\nIt has been released under the [UNLICENSE][].\n\n[UNLICENSE]: UNLICENSE\n",

    "readme": "# pseudomap\n\nA thing that is a lot like ES6 `Map`, but without iterators, for use\nin environments where `for..of` syntax and `Map` are not available.\n\nIf you need iterators, or just in general a more faithful polyfill to\nES6 Maps, check out [es6-map](http://npm.im/es6-map).\n\nIf you are in an environment where `Map` is supported, then that will\nbe returned instead, unless `process.env.TEST_PSEUDOMAP` is set.\n\nYou can use any value as keys, and any value as data.  Setting again\nwith the identical key will overwrite the previous value.\n\nInternally, data is stored on an `Object.create(null)` style object.\nThe key is coerced to a string to generate the key on the internal\ndata-bag object.  The original key used is stored along with the data.\n\nIn the event of a stringified-key collision, a new key is generated by\nappending an increasing number to the stringified-key until finding\neither the intended key or an empty spot.\n\nNote that because object traversal order of plain objects is not\nguaranteed to be identical to insertion order, the insertion order\nguarantee of `Map.prototype.forEach` is not guaranteed in this\nimplementation.  However, in all versions of Node.js and V8 where this\nmodule works, `forEach` does traverse data in insertion order.\n\n## API\n\nMost of the [Map\nAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map),\nwith the following exceptions:\n\n1. A `Map` object is not an iterator.\n2. `values`, `keys`, and `entries` methods are not implemented,\n   because they return iterators.\n3. The argument to the constructor can be an Array of `[key, value]`\n   pairs, or a `Map` or `PseudoMap` object.  But, since iterators\n   aren't used, passing any plain-old iterator won't initialize the\n   map properly.\n\n## USAGE\n\nUse just like a regular ES6 Map.\n\n```javascript\nvar PseudoMap = require('pseudomap')\n\n// optionally provide a pseudomap, or an array of [key,value] pairs\n// as the argument to initialize the map with\nvar myMap = new PseudoMap()\n\nmyMap.set(1, 'number 1')\nmyMap.set('1', 'string 1')\nvar akey = {}\nvar bkey = {}\nmyMap.set(akey, { some: 'data' })\nmyMap.set(bkey, { some: 'other data' })\n```\n",

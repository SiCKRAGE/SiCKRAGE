    "readme": "# pump\n\npump is a small node module that pipes streams together and destroys all of them if one of them closes.\n\n```\nnpm install pump\n```\n\n[![build status](http://img.shields.io/travis/mafintosh/pump.svg?style=flat)](http://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/pump)\n\n## What problem does it solve?\n\nWhen using standard `source.pipe(dest)` source will _not_ be destroyed if dest emits close or an error.\nYou are also not able to provide a callback to tell when then pipe has finished.\n\npump does these two things for you\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply pass the streams you want to pipe together to pump and add an optional callback\n\n``` js\nvar pump = require('pump')\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nvar source = fs.createReadStream('/dev/random')\nvar dest = fs.createWriteStream('/dev/null')\n\npump(source, dest, function(err) {\n  console.log('pipe finished', err)\n})\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  dest.destroy() // when dest is closed pump will destroy source\n}, 1000)\n```\n\nYou can use pump to pipe more than two streams together as well\n\n``` js\nvar transform = someTransformStream()\n\npump(source, transform, anotherTransform, dest, function(err) {\n  console.log('pipe finished', err)\n})\n```\n\nIf `source`, `transform`, `anotherTransform` or `dest` closes all of them will be destroyed.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Related\n\n`pump` is part of the [mississippi stream utility collection](https://github.com/maxogden/mississippi) which includes more useful stream modules similar to this one.\n",

The responsibilities of the Streams Working Group include:\n\n* Addressing stream issues on the Node.js issue tracker.\n* Authoring and editing stream documentation within the Node.js project.\n* Reviewing changes to stream subclasses within the Node.js project.\n* Redirecting changes to streams from the Node.js project to this\n  project.\n* Assisting in the implementation of stream providers within Node.js.\n* Recommending versions of `readable-stream` to be included in Node.js.\n* Messaging about the future of streams to give the community advance\n  notice of changes.\n\n<a name=\"members\"></a>\n## Team Members\n\n* **Chris Dickinson** ([@chrisdickinson](https://github.com/chrisdickinson)) &lt;christopher.s.dickinson@gmail.com&gt;\n  - Release GPG key: 9554F04D7259F04124DE6B476D5A82AC7E37093B\n* **Calvin Metcalf** ([@calvinmetcalf](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf)) &lt;calvin.metcalf@gmail.com&gt;\n  - Release GPG key: F3EF5F62A87FC27A22E643F714CE4FF5015AA242\n* **Rod Vagg** ([@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg)) &lt;rod@vagg.org&gt;\n  - Release GPG key: DD8F2338BAE7501E3DD5AC78C273792F7D83545D\n* **Sam Newman** ([@sonewman](https://github.com/sonewman)) &lt;newmansam@outlook.com&gt;\n* **Mathias Buus** ([@mafintosh](https://github.com/mafintosh)) &lt;mathiasbuus@gmail.com&gt;\n* **Domenic Denicola** ([@domenic](https://github.com/domenic)) &lt;d@domenic.me&gt;\n* **Matteo Collina** ([@mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina)) &lt;matteo.collina@gmail.com&gt;\n  - Release GPG key: 3ABC01543F22DD2239285CDD818674489FBC127E\n* **Irina Shestak** ([@lrlna](https://github.com/lrlna)) &lt;shestak.irina@gmail.com&gt;\n",

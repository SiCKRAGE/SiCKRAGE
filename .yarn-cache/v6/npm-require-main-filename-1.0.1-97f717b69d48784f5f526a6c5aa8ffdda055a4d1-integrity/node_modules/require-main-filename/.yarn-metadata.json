This can be combined with a module like\n[pkg-conf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg-conf) to, _as if by magic_, load\ntop-level configuration.\n\nUnfortunately, `require.main.filename` sometimes fails when an application is\nexecuted with an alternative process manager, e.g., [iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode).\n\n`require-main-filename` is a shim that addresses this problem.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar main = require('require-main-filename')()\n// use main as an alternative to require.main.filename.\n```\n\n## License\n\nISC\n",

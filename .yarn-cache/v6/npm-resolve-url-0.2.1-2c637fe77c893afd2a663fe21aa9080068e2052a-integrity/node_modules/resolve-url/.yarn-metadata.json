Resolves the last one to an absolute url, using the\nprevious ones and `window.location`.\n\nIt’s like starting out on `window.location`, and then clicking links with the\nurls as `href` attributes in order, from left to right.\n\nUnlike Node.js’ [`path.resolve`], this function always goes through all of the\narguments, from left to right. `path.resolve` goes from right to left and only\nin the worst case goes through them all. Should that matter.\n\nActually, the function is _really_ like clicking a lot of links in series: An\nactual `<a>` gets its `href` attribute set for each url! This means that the\nurl resolution of the browser is used, which makes this module really\nlight-weight.\n\nAlso note that this functions deals with urls, not paths, so in that respect it\nhas more in common with Node.js’ [`url.resolve`]. But the arguments are more\nlike [`path.resolve`].\n\n[`path.resolve`]: http://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_resolve_from_to\n[`url.resolve`]: http://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_resolve_from_to\n\n\nTests\n=====\n\nRun `npm test`, which lints the code and then gives you a link to open in a\nbrowser of choice (using `testling`).\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n[The X11 (“MIT”) License](LICENSE).\n",

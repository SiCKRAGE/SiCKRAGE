The responsibilities of the Streams Working Group include:\n\n* Addressing stream issues on the Node.js issue tracker.\n* Authoring and editing stream documentation within the Node.js project.\n* Reviewing changes to stream subclasses within the Node.js project.\n* Redirecting changes to streams from the Node.js project to this\n  project.\n* Assisting in the implementation of stream providers within Node.js.\n* Recommending versions of `readable-stream` to be included in Node.js.\n* Messaging about the future of streams to give the community advance\n  notice of changes.\n\nSee [readable-stream](https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream) for\nmore details.\n",

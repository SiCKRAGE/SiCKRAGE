Use\n[fstream](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream) to write files into the\npack stream and you will receive tar archive data from the pack\nstream.\n\nThis only works with directories, it does not work with individual files.\n\nThe optional `properties` object are used to set properties in the tar\n'Global Extended Header'. If the `fromBase` property is set to true,\nthe tar will contain files relative to the path passed, and not with\nthe path included.\n\n### tar.Extract([options])\n\nReturns a through stream. Write tar data to the stream and the files\nin the tarball will be extracted onto the filesystem.\n\n`options` can be:\n\n```js\n{\n  path: '/path/to/extract/tar/into',\n  strip: 0, // how many path segments to strip from the root when extracting\n}\n```\n\n`options` also get passed to the `fstream.Writer` instance that `tar`\nuses internally.\n\n### tar.Parse()\n\nReturns a writable stream. Write tar data to it and it will emit\n`entry` events for each entry parsed from the tarball. This is used by\n`tar.Extract`.\n",

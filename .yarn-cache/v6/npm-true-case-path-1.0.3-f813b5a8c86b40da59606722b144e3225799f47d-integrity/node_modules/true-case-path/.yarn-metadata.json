If you want to ensure\n  an absolute output path, apply `fs.realPathSync()` to the result.\n- On Windows, no attempt is made to case-correct the drive letter or UNC-share\n  component of the path.\n- Unicode support:\n  - Be sure to use UTF8 source-code files (with a BOM on Windows)\n  - On OSX, the input path is automatically converted to NFD Unicode form\n    to match how the filesystem stores names, but note that the result will\n    invariably be NFD too (which makes no difference for ASCII-characters-only\n    names).\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nconst trueCasePathSync = require('true-case-path')\n\ntrueCasePathSync('/users/guest') // OSX: -> '/Users/Guest'\n\ntrueCasePathSync('c:\\\\users\\\\all users') // Windows: -> 'c:\\Users\\All Users'\n```\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe code for this project was sourced from [http://stackoverflow.com/a/33139702/45375](http://stackoverflow.com/a/33139702/45375)\n",

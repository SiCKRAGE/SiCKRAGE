Instead a three level architecture ensures that for each directory only a single watcher exists.\n\n* The high level API requests `DirectoryWatchers` from a `WatcherManager`, which ensures that only a single `DirectoryWatcher` per directory is created.\n* A user-faced `Watcher` can be obtained from a `DirectoryWatcher` and provides a filtered view on the `DirectoryWatcher`.\n* Reference-counting is used on the `DirectoryWatcher` and `Watcher` to decide when to close them.\n* The real watchers (currently chokidar) are created by the `DirectoryWatcher`.\n* Files are never watched directly. This should keep the watcher count low.\n* Watching can be started in the past. This way watching can start after file reading.\n* Symlinks are not followed, instead the symlink is watched.\n\n## API\n\n``` javascript\nvar Watchpack = require(\"watchpack\");\n\nvar wp = new Watchpack({\n\t// options:\n\taggregateTimeout: 1000\n\t// fire \"aggregated\" event when after a change for 1000ms no additional change occurred\n\t// aggregated defaults to undefined, which doesn't fire an \"aggregated\" event\n\n\tpoll: true\n\t// poll: true - use polling with the default interval\n\t// poll: 10000 - use polling with an interval of 10s\n\t// poll defaults to undefined, which prefer native watching methods\n\t// Note: enable polling when watching on a network path\n\n\tignored: /node_modules/,\n\t// anymatch-compatible definition of files/paths to be ignored\n\t// see https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#path-filtering\n});\n\n// Watchpack.prototype.watch(string[] files, string[] directories, [number startTime])\nwp.watch(listOfFiles, listOfDirectories, Date.now() - 10000);\n// starts watching these files and directories\n// calling this again will override the files and directories\n\nwp.on(\"change\", function(filePath, mtime) {\n\t// filePath: the changed file\n\t// mtime: last modified time for the changed file\n});\n\nwp.on(\"aggregated\", function(changes) {\n\t// changes: an array of all changed files\n});\n\n// Watchpack.prototype.pause()\nwp.pause();\n// stops emitting events, but keeps watchers open\n// next \"watch\" call can reuse the watchers\n\n// Watchpack.prototype.close()\nwp.close();\n// stops emitting events and closes all watchers\n\n// Watchpack.prototype.getTimes()\nvar fileTimes = wp.getTimes();\n// returns an object with all know change times for files\n// this include timestamps from files not directly watched\n// key: absolute path, value: timestamp as number\n```\n\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/watchpack/\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/watchpack.svg\n",

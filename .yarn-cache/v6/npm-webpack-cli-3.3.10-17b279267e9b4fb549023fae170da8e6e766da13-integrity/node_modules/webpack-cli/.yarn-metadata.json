As of webpack v4, webpack is not expecting a configuration file, but often developers want to create a more custom webpack configuration based on their use-cases and needs. webpack CLI addresses these needs by providing a set of tools to improve the setup of custom webpack configuration.\n\n### How to install\n\nWhen you have followed the [Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) guide of webpack then webpack CLI is already installed!\n\nOtherwise `npm install --save-dev webpack-cli` or `yarn add webpack-cli --dev` will install it.\n\n## Packages\n\nWe organize webpack CLI as a multi-package repository using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). Every command has a dedicated subfolder in the `packages` Folder. Here's a summary of commands provided by the CLI.\n\n### Commands\n\nSupporting developers is an important task for webpack CLI. Thus, webpack CLI provides different commands for many common tasks.\n\n-   [`webpack-cli init`](./packages/init/README.md#webpack-cli-init) - Create a new webpack configuration.\n-   [`webpack-cli info`](./packages/info/README.md#webpack-cli-info) - Returns information related to the local environment.\n-   [`webpack-cli migrate`](./packages/migrate/README.md#webpack-cli-migrate) - Migrate project from one version to another.\n-   [`webpack-cli generate-plugin`](./packages/generate-plugin/README.md#webpack-cli-generate-plugin) - Initiate new plugin project.\n-   [`webpack-cli generate-loader`](./packages/generate-loader/README.md#webpack-cli-generate-loader) - Initiate new loader project.\n-   [`webpack-cli serve`](./packages/serve/README.md#webpack-cli-serve) - Use webpack with a development server that provides live reloading.\n\n### Utilities\n\nThe project also has several utility packages which are used by other commands\n\n-   [`utils`](./packages/utils/README.md) - Several utilities used across webpack-cli.\n-   [`generators`](./packages/generators/README.md) - Contains all webpack-cli related yeoman generators.\n-   [`webpack-scaffold`](./packages/webpack-scaffold/README.md) - Utilities to create a webpack scaffold.\n\n## Getting started\n\nWhen you have followed the [Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) guide of webpack then webpack CLI is already installed! Otherwise, you would need to install webpack CLI and the packages you want to use. If we want to use the `init` command to create a new `webpack.config.js` configuration file:\n\n```sh\nnpm i webpack-cli @webpack-cli/init\nnpx webpack-cli init\n```\n\nYou will be prompted for some questions about what how you want to generate your config file when running the `init` command so webpack CLI can provide the best fitting configuration.\n\n## webpack CLI Scaffolds\n\nWith v3 of webpack CLI, we introduced scaffolding as an integral part of the CLI. Our goal is to simplify the creation of webpack configurations for different purposes. Additionally, sharing such solutions with the community is beneficial and with webpack, we want to allow this. We provide `webpack-scaffold` as a utility suite for creating these scaffolds. It contains functions that could be of use for creating a scaffold yourself.\n\nYou can read more about [Scaffolding](https://webpack.js.org/guides/scaffolding), learn [How to compose a webpack-scaffold?](https://webpack.js.org/contribute/writing-a-scaffold) or generate one with [webpack-scaffold-starter](https://github.com/rishabh3112/webpack-scaffold-starter).\n\n## Contributing and Internal Documentation\n\nThe webpack family welcomes any contributor, small or big. We are happy to elaborate, guide you through the source code and find issues you might want to work on! To get started have a look at our [documentation on contributing](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Open Collective\n\nIf you like **webpack**, please consider donating to our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/webpack) to help us maintain it.\n\n[build-status]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack-cli.svg\n[build-status-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack-cli\n[build-status-azure]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack-cli\n[build-status-azure-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=4\n[chat]: https://badges.gitter.im/webpack/webpack.svg\n[chat-url]: https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack\n[contributors]: https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/webpack/webpack-cli.svg\n[contributors-url]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/graphs/contributors\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack-cli\n[downloads]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/webpack-cli.svg\n[downloads-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli\n[lerna]: https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg\n[lerna-url]: http://www.lernajs.io/\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack-cli.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli\n[maintainability]: https://codeclimate.com/github/webpack/webpack-cli/badges/gpa.svg\n[maintainability-url]: https://codeclimate.com/github/webpack/webpack-cli\n[size]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=webpack-cli\n[size-url]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=webpack-cli\n",

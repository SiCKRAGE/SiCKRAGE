    "readme": "# webpack-sources\n\nContains multiple classes which represent a `Source`. A `Source` can be asked for source code, size, source map and hash.\n\n## `Source`\n\nBase class for all sources.\n\n### Public methods\n\nAll methods should be considered as expensive as they may need to do computations.\n\n#### `source`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.source() -> String | ArrayBuffer\n```\n\nReturns the represented source code as string.\n\n#### `size`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.size() -> Number\n```\n\nReturns the size in chars of the represented source code.\n\n#### `map`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.map(options: Object) -> Object | null\n```\n\nReturns the SourceMap of the represented source code as JSON. May return `null` if no SourceMap is available.\n\nThe `options` object can contain the following keys:\n\n* `columns: Boolean` (default `true`): If set to false the implementation may omit mappings for columns.\n* `module: Boolean` (default `true`): If set to false the implementation may omit inner mappings for modules.\n\n#### `sourceAndMap`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.sourceAndMap(options: Object) -> {\n\tsource: String,\n\tmap: Object\n}\n```\n\nReturns both, source code (like `Source.prototype.source()` and SourceMap (like `Source.prototype.map()`). This method could have better performance than calling `source()` and `map()` separately.\n\nSee `map()` for `options`.\n\n#### `updateHash`\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.updateHash(hash: Hash) -> void\n```\n\nUpdates the provided `Hash` object with the content of the represented source code. (`Hash` is an object with an `update` method, which is called with string values)\n\n#### `node` (optional)\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.node(options: Object) -> SourceNode\n```\n\nThis is an optional method. It may be `null` if not implemented.\n\nReturns a `SourceNode` (see source-map library) for the represented source code.\n\nSee `map()` for `options`.\n\n#### `listNode` (optional)\n\n``` js\nSource.prototype.listNode(options: Object) -> SourceNode\n```\n\nThis is an optional method. It may be `null` if not implemented.\n\nReturns a `SourceListMap` (see source-list-map library) for the represented source code.\n\nSee `map()` for `options`.\n\n## `RawSource`\n\nRepresents source code without SourceMap.\n\n``` js\nnew RawSource(sourceCode: String)\n```\n\n## `OriginalSource`\n\nRepresents source code, which is a copy of the original file.\n\n``` js\nnew OriginalSource(\n\tsourceCode: String,\n\tname: String\n)\n```\n\n* `sourceCode`: The source code.\n* `name`: The filename of the original source code.\n\nOriginalSource tries to create column mappings if requested, by splitting the source code at typical statement borders (`;`, `{`, `}`).\n\n## `SourceMapSource`\n\nRepresents source code with SourceMap, optionally having an additional SourceMap for the original source.\n\n``` js\nnew SourceMapSource(\n\tsourceCode: String,\n\tname: String,\n\tsourceMap: Object | String,\n\toriginalSource?: String,\n\tinnerSourceMap?: Object | String,\n\tremoveOriginalSource?: boolean\n)\n```\n\n* `sourceCode`: The source code.\n* `name`: The filename of the original source code.\n* `sourceMap`: The SourceMap for the source code.\n* `originalSource`: The source code of the original file. Can be omitted if the `sourceMap` already contains the original source code.\n* `innerSourceMap`: The SourceMap for the `originalSource`/`name`.\n* `removeOriginalSource`: Removes the source code for `name` from the final map, keeping only the deeper mappings for that file.\n\nThe `SourceMapSource` supports \"identity\" mappings for the `innerSourceMap`.\nWhen original source matches generated source for a mapping it's assumed to be mapped char by char allowing to keep finer mappings from `sourceMap`.\n\n## `LineToLineMappedSource`\n\nRepresents source code, which is mapped line by line to the original file.\n\n``` js\nnew LineToLineMappedSource(\n\tsourceCode: String,\n\tname: String,\n\toriginalSource: String\n)\n```\n\n* `sourceCode`: The source code.\n* `name`: The filename of the original source code.\n* `originalSource`: The original source code.\n\n## `CachedSource`\n\nDecorates a `Source` and caches returned results of `map`, `source`, `size` and `sourceAndMap` in memory. Every other operation is delegated to the wrapped `Source`.\n\n``` js\nnew CachedSource(source: Source)\n```\n\n## `PrefixSource`\n\nPrefix every line of the decorated `Source` with a provided string.\n\n``` js\nnew PrefixSource(\n\tprefix: String,\n\tsource: Source\n)\n```\n\n## `ConcatSource`\n\nConcatenate multiple `Source`s or strings to a single source.\n\n``` js\nnew ConcatSource(\n\t...items?: Source | String\n)\n```\n\n### Public methods\n\n#### `add`\n\n``` js\nConcatSource.prototype.add(item: Source | String)\n```\n\nAdds an item to the source.\n\n## `ReplaceSource`\n\nDecorates a `Source` with replacements and insertions of source code.\n\nThe `ReplaceSource` supports \"identity\" mappings for child source.\nWhen original source matches generated source for a mapping it's assumed to be mapped char by char allowing to split mappings at replacements/insertions.\n\n### Public methods\n\n#### `replace`\n\n``` js\nReplaceSource.prototype.replace(\n\tstart: Number,\n\tend: Number,\n\treplacement: String\n)\n```\n\nReplaces chars from `start` (0-indexed, inclusive) to `end` (0-indexed, inclusive) with `replacement`.\n\nLocations represents locations in the original source and are not influenced by other replacements or insertions.\n\n#### `insert`\n\n``` js\nReplaceSource.prototype.insert(\n\tpos: Number,\n\tinsertion: String\n)\n```\n\nInserts the `insertion` before char `pos` (0-indexed).\n\nLocation represents location in the original source and is not influenced by other replacements or insertions.\n\n#### `original`\n\nGet decorated `Source`.\n\n",

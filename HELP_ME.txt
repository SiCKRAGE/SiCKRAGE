Hi

I've several bug reports but I can't comment/post in the forums… can you please check my user "dbarton"? Haven't got a confirmation email so far, so I can't do anything to report bugs or get in contact with you!

Bugs/issues found so far:

- UnicodeError messages
- Mako errors
- Limited capability to add existing TV shows (http://cloud.confirm.ch/iAzh)
- Mass update for TV shows doesn't work (HTTP 500)
- Home view sometimes doesn't show correct statistics (a lot of ?, after reload all is fine)
- Startup of SiCKRAGE takes about 10 minutes until webui is availabe
- Fresh re-install and reindex all my TV shows takes about 3 days

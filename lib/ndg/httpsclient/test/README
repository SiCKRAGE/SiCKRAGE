NDG HTTPS Client Unit tests directory
=====================================
The unit tests expect to connect to a simple HTTPS server listening on port 
4443.  An OpenSSL script is provided for this purpose in scripts/.  To run,

$ ./scripts/openssl_https_server.sh

Unit tests
----------
Run for example,

$ python ./test_urllib2.py

Troubleshooting
---------------
 * Run the openssl script from *this* directory.  
 * Also ensure it is has execute bits set. e.g.

 $ chmod 755 ./scripts/openssl_https_server.sh
 
 * You may need to set the no_proxy environment variable if you have a HTTPS
 proxy in place:
 
 $ export no_proxy=localhost

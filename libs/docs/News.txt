SQLObject 2.1.2
===============

Released 15 Mar 2015.

* Using fdb adapter for Firebird was ported from `SQLObject 1.6.6`_.

SQLObject 2.1.1
===============

Released 10 Mar 2015.

* Minor fix in PostgresConnection was ported from `SQLObject 1.6.5`_.

SQLObject 2.1.0
===============

Released 6 Jan 2015.

Minor features
--------------

* In queries generated with SQLObject's tables columns are sorted in the
  order they are declared in the table.

* In queries generated with sqlbuilder's Insert/Update, if values are
  passed using dictionaries, columns are sorted alphabetically.

* Tables in SELECT...FROM clause are sorted alphabetically.

* MySQLConnection, PostgresConnection and SQLiteConnection have got
  a new method listDatabases() that lists databases in the connection
  and returns a list of names.

* MySQLConnection, PostgresConnection and SQLiteConnection have got
  a new method listTables() that returns a list of table names in the database.

SQLObject 2.0.0
===============

Released 20 Dec 2014.

Features & Interface
--------------------

* DateTimeCol and TimeCol can read and write values with microseconds.

  WARNING: microseconds are supported by MariaDB since version 5.3.0 and
  by MySQL since version 5.6.4, and even these versions require special
  handling: columns to store microseconds have to be declared with
  precision 6: TIME(6), DATETIME(6), TIMESTAMP(6). SQLObject does the
  right thing when creating a new database but existing databases have
  to be changed: run something like
  ``ALTER TABLE name MODIFY COLUMN col TIME(6)`` for every column that
  you want to store microseconds.

  WARNING: backward compatibility problem! Date/Time columns created
  with microseconds cannot be read back from SQLite databases (and
  perhaps other backends) with versions of SQLObject older than 1.7.

Minor features
--------------

* PostgresConnection, when used with fromDatabase=True, sets alternateID
  for unique columns.

Development
-----------

* Development was switched from Subversion to git.

Documentation
-------------

* Old news were restored back to version 0.2.1.

* News.txt was split into 5 small files.

  Select(['id, 'name'], where='value = 42'). Update allows a string in
  WHERE.

  point to a non-id column; the referred column must be a unique integer
  column.

  autocommit attribute was fixed.

SQLObject 1.1
=============

Released 20 Jun 2011.

Features & Interface
--------------------

* SelectResults (returned from .select()) is allowed in IN(column, list).

* A different workaround is used in SQLiteConnection to prevent PySQLite
  from converting strings to unicode - in the case of a registered text
  conversion function PySQLite silently converts empty strings to Nones;
  now SQLObject uses text_factory instead and properly returns empty
  strings.

* It is now possible to declare one encoding for all UnicodeCol's per
  table (as sqlmeta.dbEncoding) or per connection (as connection.dbEncoding).
  Default (if dbEncoding is found neither in column nor in table nor in
  connection) is 'utf-8'.

Source code and internals
-------------------------

* Decorators @classmethod and @staticmethod are used everywhere.

* All 'mydict.has_key(name)' checks were replaced with 'name in mydict'.

SQLObject 1.0.3

SQLObject 1.0.2
===============

Released 8 Aug 2011.

  slice (my_results[:20][1:5]).

SQLObject 1.0.1
===============

Released 30 May 2011.

* A syntax incompatibility was fixed in SQLiteConnection that prevented
  SQLObject to be used with Python 2.4.

SQLObject 1.0.0
===============

Released 28 Mar 2011.

Features & Interface
--------------------

* Major API change: DB URI parser was changed to use urllib.split*() and
  unquote(). This means any username/password/path are allowed in DB
  URIs if they are properly %-encoded, and DB URIs are automatically
  unquoted.

* A new module ``__version__.py`` was added. New variables ``version``
  (string) and ``version_info`` (5-tuple: major, minor, micro, release
  level, serial) are imported into ``sqlobject`` namespace.

* In SQLite, id columns are made AUTOINCREMENT.

* Parameter ``backend`` in DB URI is no longer supported, use parameter
  ``driver``.
